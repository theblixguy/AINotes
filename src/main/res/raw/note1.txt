At 01:32 on 14 November the Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management issued a tsunami warning for the eastern coasts of the North and South Islands and the  Chatham Islands. A wave of 2.5 m was recorded at Kaikoura, 1 m at Christchurch, and 0.5 m at Wellington. A wave of 0.2 m was recorded in Napier at about 3am. A tsunami estimated at five metres high struck the north-facing Little Pigeon Bay on Banks Peninsula. The bay contained only one building, an unoccupied holiday house that was pushed off its foundations and heavily damaged. In neighbouring Pigeon Bay the tsunami was observed at about 2am but caused no damage.Two deaths were reported: one person suffered a heart attack, while the other was crushed when the historic Elms Farm homestead near Kaikoura collapsed. Two people were rescued from the rubble of the house, including the victim's 100-year-old mother. Many major roads were closed in the South Island because of slips and damage to bridges, including State Highway 1 between Picton and Waipara, and State Highway 7 between Waipara and Springs Junction (SH 65 turnoff). Most roads were cleared within 24 hours, but SH 1 between Seddon and Cheviot via Kaikoura and the Inland Kaikoura Road remained closed.
