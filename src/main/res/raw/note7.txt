Lurkmore was started as a knowledge base of Internet memes centered on 2ch.ru, the first popular Russian-language imageboard. With time, the project evolved to encompass the broader Runet subculture. It has been called an "informal encyclopedia" about everything. Currently, Lurkmore comprises a wide range of articles, but a very considerable share of them is still about the Internet culture. Lurkmore articles use a distinctive style, distinguishing themselves with a general informality, semiseriousness, sarcasm, the free use of foul language, and impudence, as well as by sharp criticism of the shortcomings of the considered phenomena. The articles are also characterized by a specific slang "lurkoyaz" consisting of Internet slang, assorted words used by padonki and Kashchenists, as well as Lurkmore's own neologisms. Remarkable feature of the project is concealment of IP addresses of anonymous participants in the history of editings of articles for all except administrators. The inscription of "Anonimus" is displayed instead of IP addresses. The registered participants having a flag of the autoconfirmed participant also have an opportunity to leave any editing not under the name, and anonymously.
