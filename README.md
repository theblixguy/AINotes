# AINotes

BUILT AT OXFORDHACK 2016

## Inspiration

We all use Note taking apps like Evernote or Google Keep (some of us use them pretty heavily), but AI/Machine Learning could make the experience more richer and user friendly.

## What it does

- Use NLP to understand queries to search through user's notes (DONE)
- Use AI to correct mistakes in notes (TODO)
- Use AI to automatically generate tags for notes for easy searching (TODO)
- Use AI to offer rich suggestions to improve the note (TODO)
- Use AI to extract useful information from the notes to offer summaries (TODO)

## How I built it

Android Studio and Project Oxford APIs

## Challenges I ran into

Microsoft's website isn't showing the subscription page where you can access subscription keys for other APIs, so not able to use the other API's at the moment

## What I learned

Many things about AI, NLP and machine learning

## What's next for AINotes

Complete this app, polish it and launch it for public next year!
